UGE Python Configuration Library
================================

Prerequisites
-------------

UGE PyCL requires recent versions of the following software:

1. UGE (8.3.1p9, 8.4.0, or later)
2. Python (v2.7.5 or later in v2.7 series)
3. Setuptools (0.9.8 or later; for egg installation)
4. Nose (1.3.7 or later; for testing)
5. Sphinx (1.1.3 or later; for generating documentation)
6. Standard development tools (make)

The software versions listed above were used for prototype development
and testing, on CentOS 7.2 (64-bit). It is likely that any recent
version of Python (such as those that come with current linux
distributions) should work. UGE versions 8.3.1p9 or later or 8.4.0 and
later will work with the Configuration API. Minor modifications to the
code that checks versions will have to be made to support versions
greater than 8.4.0.

Build
-----

In the top level directory run:

.. code:: sh

   $ make 

The above command will create UGE PyCL egg package in the ``dist``
directory, which can be installed using the ``easy_install`` command. It
will also run ``sphinx-build`` command and generate HTML documentation
in the ``dist/doc/html`` directory.

Basic API Usage
---------------

For simple testing, without installing UGE PyCL egg package, do the
following:

1) Setup PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to the top level
   directory:

.. code:: sh

   $ export PYTHONPATH=<UGE_PYCL_ROOT>

Note that the above step is not needed if UGE PyCL egg package is
installed.

2) Source the appropriate UGE setup file:

.. code:: sh

   $ source <SGE_ROOT>/<SGE_CELL>/settings.sh

3) List queues using QconfApi object:

.. code:: sh

   $ python -c "from uge.api import QconfApi; api = QconfApi(); print api.list_queues()"

Running Test Suite
------------------

1) Setup PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to the top level
   directory:

.. code:: sh

   $ export PYTHONPATH=<UGE_PYCL_ROOT>

This step is not needed if UGE PyCL egg package is installed.

2) Source the appropriate UGE setup file:

.. code:: sh

   $ source <SGE_ROOT>/<SGE_CELL>/settings.sh

3) Run test suite:

adjust test_values.json according to your needs, esp.Â the host_names
have to be resolvable, otherwise some execution host tests might fail

.. code:: sh

   $ make test
